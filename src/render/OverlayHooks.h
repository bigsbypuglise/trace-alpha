// What the overlay is allowed to ask the application to do.

// The split is deliberate and is the rule the spike is built to respect: the
// renderer owns VISUAL GEOMETRY AND HIT REGIONS, the application owns COMMANDS
// AND STATE. Nothing here returns a handle to playback; every entry is either a
// request to run an existing action or a read of state the application already
// holds. There is no renderer-owned playback state to get out of step.
//
// Scrubbing is expressed as press / move / release rather than as a single
// "seek", so it can be routed through the real timeline slider -- which means
// the overlay inherits the entire existing scrub path, including the drag
// shuttle and the step 5.6 play-state restore, instead of reimplementing any of
// it.
