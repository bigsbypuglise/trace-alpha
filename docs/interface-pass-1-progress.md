# Interface pass 1 — phase record

One section per shipped phase. The phase 1 audit is its own document
(`docs/interface-pass-1-audit.md`) and is read-only; this is where what actually
shipped, and what the shipping changed about the plan, gets written down.

Every phase carries its own playback and scrub regression, because priority 1
outranks the pass and phase 14 is too late to find out.

## Phase 2 — shared actions and transport artwork integration (`58bfca6`, 2026-08-10)

### What shipped

**Fullscreen is a shared QAction.** `fullscreenAction_`, checkable, created in a
new `setupSharedActions()` that runs *before* `setupMenus()` — a menu adds an
action, it never defines one. The File menu, the transport button and three
shortcuts all reach the same object, and `toggleFullscreen()` is the single place
the window state changes. It re-reads `isFullScreen()` afterwards rather than
trusting the toggle, so the action's tick, `viewState_.fullscreen` and the button
icon all come from what the window manager actually did.

**F11 is listed first among its shortcuts, and that is load-bearing rather than
cosmetic.** Qt advertises only the first sequence — in the menu, and in whatever
a tooltip is written to say. Ctrl+Return is kept because the spec's own rule is
to preserve an existing binding on conflict, and Alt+Enter is the spec's second.
Escape-exits, geometry save/restore and the monitor rule are **phase 6**: they
change what the toggle *does*, and this phase only changed how many places
define it.

**The dev HUD toggle is a shared QAction on `H`** (owner request, 2026-08-10),
with Return/Enter kept as the binding it has always had.

**`showInfo` is deleted, not wired up.** `Qt::Key_I` toggled it and *nothing read
it*, so pressing `I` repainted and changed nothing — a flag with a shortcut and
no reader reads as a broken feature rather than as an absent one. There is one
HUD and it is `showHud`; the spec claims `Ctrl+I` for the Movie Inspector, so
leaving plain `I` as a second, differently-scoped info toggle would have created
an ambiguity for nothing. `showTimecode` and `showSeconds` were dead in exactly
the same way and went with it.

**Hidden now means NOT BUILT.** `refreshHud` returns before formatting several
hundred bytes of `QString` for a widget nobody can see. The pre-existing Return
binding hid the widget and built the line anyway, so "hide the HUD" cost exactly
nothing before this — and the owner's stated reason for wanting the key is to
judge feel *without the instrument*, which means without its cost.

The telemetry capture still runs, and that is deliberate: it is a struct copy,
and it feeds `ra-walk` and the seek counters. **A counter that measures something
different depending on whether the HUD happened to be visible** is the failure
this project keeps re-learning, and it would have been introduced here for a
saving of nothing.

**One icon source.** The `260807` package supersedes both older ones and says so
in its own `CONTENTS.txt`. `assets/icons/` is deleted (app icon; the new package
ships identical filenames, so it is a path change). App icon, play, pause and
both fullscreen glyphs now come from the approved set, along with its state
opacities — rest 0.82, hover fill 0.09, pressed 0.17, disabled 0.28.

**Its control geometry is deliberately NOT adopted.** The approved package
specifies 34×34 utility targets and a 44×44 play/pause inside a rounded panel,
but that is the geometry of the **floating transport**, which is what phase 6
puts on screen when it removes `transportBar_` from the layout entirely.
Re-laying-out a widget that is about to be deleted is churn the spec does not ask
for, and it would move the video rect — and therefore invalidate every scrub
baseline — for a component with no future.

### The rule the artwork follows, and why one directory survives

**Artwork follows behaviour.** The approved package contains no frame-step icon
*by design* ("Left/Right Arrow handle single frames"), and its
`transport_scan_*` pair is the artwork for the **redesigned** Rewind and
Fast-forward — controls that still perform single-frame stepping until phases 4
and 5. Putting scan artwork on a stepping button would put a lie on a visible
control in a player whose third pillar is that it can be trusted.

So `assets/Interface/` survives for **exactly two glyphs** and leaves with them
at phases 4–5. `transport_scan_*` is embedded in the `.qrc` now, unused, so those
phases are a code change only.

The same rule fixed something in the composited overlay rather than preserving
it. Play/pause took the approved glyphs; the two side regions took the
**frame-step** glyphs, matching the actions they actually call. Before this the
overlay drew continuous-scan chevrons over stepping behaviour and the mismatch
was *recorded* rather than fixed — the right call while the art was placeholder,
and the wrong state to keep once it is real. Both halves move together at phases
4 and 5.

The atlas is still rasterised once per size change, into a cell exactly the size
of the snapped destination rect, so the 1:1 blit and the measured cross-backend
agreement are untouched. Confirmed below rather than argued.

### Regression

Control binary built from `87a39a6`; **both binaries measured on the physical
panel** (5120×1440 @ 239.999Hz), `d3d11` default, `win 1280x843` / `1280x829`.

The display changed from Parsec's 1920×1200 @ 60Hz to the panel *part-way
through this session*, which invalidated a baseline already taken — so the
control was rebuilt and re-measured rather than compared across displays.

| run | control | phase 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 4K H.264 playback | 99.1%, 120/120, `handler>budget 0 of 120` (max 3.8), `hitch 0` | 99.1%, 120/120, `0 of 120` (max 3.9), `hitch 0` |
| 4444 playback | 99.7%, 223 frames, `0 of 222` (max 38.1), `hitch 0` | 99.7%, 223 frames, `0 of 222` (max 35.9), `hitch 0` |
| 4K H.264 reversals | `hitch 1`, `delta 0`, `rev-hit 98.6%`, `ui gap max 85.4ms` | `hitch 1`, `delta 0`, `rev-hit 98.7%`, `ui gap max 84.7ms` |
| 4444 reversals ×3 | `hitch 12, 12, 8` | `hitch 7, 10, 10` |
| `-SnapRelease` | — | `target 120 shown 120 delta 0`, full-res, `hitch 0` |
| lifecycle | — | `-PlayThroughDrag` PASS 40.1% moved, `-PausedThroughDrag` PASS 0% |
| revtransitions | — | all six shuttle exits PASS |
| overlay, 12 states | cpu-vs-d3d11 **312 px (0.619%), max delta 24** | **312 px (0.619%), max delta 24** |

Cadence buckets are identical on both files. Landing is exact on every run.

**The overlay diff is the same number to the pixel on both binaries**, which is
what says the artwork swap changed the cross-backend agreement by nothing. The
0.619% is pre-existing and is the video picture's own backend difference inside
the sampled band, not the panel.

**One number moved and it was noise.** 4444 drag `p2p max` read 151ms on one
control run and 1823ms on one phase-2 run — a 12× difference on the noisiest
statistic available (single worst sample, on the file with 13% supply). Three
runs each: control **151 / 1953 / 1148**, phase 2 **1823 / 883 / 733**.
Overlapping ranges, and a 13× spread *inside the control alone*. There is also no
mechanism: the overlay is off by default so `OverlayModel::buildFrame` returns
before doing anything, and `QAction::setChecked` early-outs on an unchanged
value.

### What phase 2 changes about the plan

**The handoff note's safeguard for the `H` toggle does not work, and the note
said it did.** It predicted — correctly — that hiding the HUD would move stall
counts, and concluded that the existing discipline covers it "because `win WxH`
changes with the toggle".

**It does not change.** Measured on the same 4K H.264 reversal drag, HUD shown
against HUD hidden: `win 1280x843` **both times**. The window does not resize.
The *viewer* takes the HUD's height, so what moves is the **video rect**, which
the HUD reports as `display`:

| | `win` | `display` | `paints` | `stalls` | `hitch` | cache |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HUD shown | 1280x843 | 640x360 | 374/375 | 70 of 370 | 1 | 197/278 (272.0MB) |
| HUD hidden | 1280x843 | **1280x720** | 456/455 | **127 of 450** | 1 | 237/296 (307.2MB) |

Previews get four times the area, fewer fit the byte budget, and `stalls` nearly
doubles from pressing one key. **Quote `display` as well as `win WxH` for any
number taken with the HUD toggled.** `hitch` read 1 either way — the fourth time
this project has found that the threshold-independent figure is the one that
survives a changed denominator.

### Still true after phase 2

- Phase 3 should build a **shortcut table** rather than extend `keyPressEvent`'s
  flat switch, because phase 13 has to render a Keyboard Shortcuts window from
  something. Phase 2 removed two cases from that switch (`I`, `Return`/`Enter`)
  and added no new ones — the two new shortcuts live on their actions.
- Phases 4–5 must **extract the five-step shuttle sequence before adding a third
  caller**, and the buttons must enter the ladder at **2×** while J/L enter at
  **1×**.
- **There is still no text-entry control anywhere in the app**, so the spec's
  "must not fire while focus is inside a text-entry control" still has nothing to
  guard. Qt's mechanism covers it when there is one: `QLineEdit` and friends
  accept `QEvent::ShortcutOverride` for printable keys, which suppresses the
  shortcut and delivers the keystroke. **That is untested because it is untestable
  today** — Go to Frame and Go to Timecode create the first text field at phase 7,
  and verifying that `H` does not eat a digit belongs with them.
